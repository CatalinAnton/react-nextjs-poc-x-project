Disclaimers:
- The scope of this project was to familiarise myself with the latest version of React and with Nextjs 14 and  their tools and utilities, such as:
  - nextauth
  - folder-based nextjs routing
  - react hooks usage and their perks and edge cases
  - interaction with third party apis
- the styling is pretty rough around the edges, as this was not a css exercise
- this project is inspired and following https://www.jsmastery.pro course

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
